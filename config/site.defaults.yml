# set this option differently in each or you'll lose your session whenever you move between them
# in your browser.

### Server and network setup ###

# In many installations, db/files/courses must be available to the apache user.
# Either give everyone read access to it (the default) or give the tmc server user
# and the apache user a common group and set chmod: g+rX and chgrp: the-common-group.

# then this should be "/tmc".

# A remote sandbox will need to contact the web server when it's done processing.
# Enter the baseurl of the webapp with which the sandboxes will find the web server.
baseurl_for_remote_sandboxes: http://localhost:3000/

# List at least one sandbox instance here (in site.yml).
#
# Any URL will do. Example:
# http://user:password@sandbox.example.com:3001/path/to/the/sandbox/service
#
# The default points to the local instance that may be started with
# `rvmsudo ext/tmc-sandbox/web/webapp.rb run`.
#
remote_sandboxes:
  - http://localhost:3001/

# List of spyware server URLs. See https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-spyware-server
# The URLs should work from both clients and the server.
# This list will be delivered to the client in /courses.json.
# The server may also send some data to the spyware servers.
#
# The default points to the dev instance that may be started with
# `ext/tmc-spyware-server/dev.rb`
#

  - http://localhost:3101/

# The URL and publish key to a tmc-comet server.
# The publish key and the baseurl of this server must also be set in
# ext/tmc-comet/config.properties (see tmc-comet's readme).
comet_server:
  # The URL is used to access the comet server as well as to serve
  # javascript URLs to the web, so it must be accessible from the outside as well.
  url: http://localhost:8080/
  # The backend key is used to authenticate with the comet server
  backend_key: set_me_in_site_yml
  # Used to distinguish this server instance from others.
  # A single tmc-comet instance can serve more than one TMC server instance.

# The memory limit for a submission in megabytes.
# Currently this should be configured to be 32M lower than the
# instance_ram setting of sandboxes. For now all this setting
# does is send the memory limit to the NetBeans plugin
# for use in local tests.
