# Caches results from scanning for tests.
#
# CourseRefresher needs to find the available points in the tests.
# This is a slow operation as it invokes the Java compiler as an annotation processor
# in order to find the @Points annotations. For a large repo, this adds up.
# This class stores a cache of test cases and their available points.
# It is keyed by a hash of the relevant files in an exercise dir.
