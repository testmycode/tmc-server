# Stores whether and when an exercise has been unlocked for an user.
#
# An exercise is considered unlocked for a user if an unlock for
# (user, course, exercise, valid_after < Time.now) exists.
# The set of unlocks for a (course, user) is recomputed in the following cases:
# - the course is refreshed (since the specs might change)
# - the user has a submission graded
#
# However, if the course has deadlines based on the unlock times of exercises,
# we require the user to explicitly unlock the next set of exercises to avoid
# starting the timer prematurely.
