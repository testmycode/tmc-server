# Test My Code server #

*Test My Code* ("TMC") is a tool to automate most of the exercise checking when teaching programming.
It runs code submitted by students, gives feedback if tests fail and maintains a scoreboard.
This allows for lots of small exercises without the need for course instructors to manually go through all of them.

The system has been used with great success by the [University of Helsinki CS Dept.](http://cs.helsinki.fi/) in
several elementary programming and data structures courses with hundreds of users.

The project started as a Software Engineering Lab project at the [University of Helsinki CS Dept.](http://cs.helsinki.fi/) but has since been gradually almost completely rewritten. The original authors of the server component were

- Patrik Marjanen
- Jarno Mynttinen
- Martti Rannanjärvi ([mrannanj](https://github.com/mrannanj))

Another team wrote a [NetBeans plugin](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-netbeans) for the system.

The course instructor and current maintainer of the project is Martin Pärtel ([mpartel](https://github.com/mpartel)). Other closely involved instructors were

- Matti Luukkainen ([mluukkai](https://github.com/mluukkai))
- Antti Laaksonen
- Arto Vihavainen
- Jaakko Kurhila

The system was improved and C language support was added in another SE lab project by

- Jarmo Isotalo ([jamox](https://github.com/jamox))
- Tony Kovanen ([rase-](https://github.com/rase-))
- Kalle Viiri ([Kviiri](https://github.com/Kviiri))
