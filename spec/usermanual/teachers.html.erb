  <h1>Teacher Manual</h1>

    <div id="toc"></div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      A teacher is a user that controls their own organization. An organization can have several teachers, and they all can create and manage courses. One teacher can also belong to several organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a teacher, you can create fully functional courses from available templates. You can customize exercise sets, their deadlines and unlock conditions etc. Courses can also have customized feedback questions which are shown to students after they have successfully submitted an exercise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Courses can also have course assistants. Course assistants can do the same things as teachers, but only for specified courses. A teacher is a per-organisation role, while the course assistant is a per-course role.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating an organization</h2>

    <p>
      When you are rolling out TMC for your own teaching, the first step is to create your own organization. If your organization is big, such as a larger school, it's good to check from the front page if an organization for your school already exists in the system. If it does exist, you should contact the other teachers and ask them for access to that organization. We would like to avoid making multiple organisations for a single school.
    </p>

    <p>
      To create a new organization, you have to be logged in at <a href="https://tmc.mooc.fi" target="_blank">https://tmc.mooc.fi</a>. If needed, click the <em>Sign up</em> link and create your own personal account. When logged in, go to the url <a href="https://tmc.mooc.fi/setup/new" target="_blank">https://tmc.mooc.fi/setup/new</a> in the TMC system to create a new organization.
    </p>

<%
  visit '/login'
  fill_in 'username', with: 'teacher'
  fill_in 'password', with: 'teacher'
  click_on 'Sign in'
%>
<%
  visit '/setup/new'
  fill_in 'organization_name', with: 'Helsingin yliopisto'
  fill_in 'organization_information', with: 'University life'
  fill_in 'organization_website', with: 'http://www.helsinki.fi'
  fill_in 'organization_slug', with: 'hy'
  fill_in 'organization_contact_information', with: 'Matti Meikäläinen'
  fill_in 'organization_phone', with: '+3584012345678'
  fill_in 'organization_email', with: 'matti@meikalainen.fi'
  highlight '[value="Create Organization"]'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<p>
  You will then be presented with a form with following fields, all of which can be changed later:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Name</b> of the organization that will be seen in the TMC pages</li>
    <li><b>Information</b>, a longer description of your organization, seen on this organization's page</li>
    <li><b>Website</b> of your organization</li>
    <li><b>Organization ID</b>, a short word that will be part of your organization's url. You will have an opportunity to preview organization's url. Note that the ID must not contain hyphens ('-' character)</li>
    <li><b>Logo</b> for your organization, seen on this organization's page</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Also enter your contact details for TMC administrative purposes. These are not shown publicly.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Contact person name</b>, who is responsible for this organization. Also some more specific information can be included</li>
    <li><b>Phone number</b> for the contact person</li>
    <li><b>Email</b> for the contact person. If you are from an educational institution, please use an email for that institution if possible.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<%
  click_on 'Create Organization'
  expect(page).to have_content("Organization was successfully created.")
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<p>
  When you have successfully created your organization, it is ready for use. Some functionalities, like model answers, are not available until administrators have verified the organization. When logged in, your organization is listed separately on TMC front page. Verified organizations are also publicly listed.
</p>

  fill_in 'password', with: 'teacher'
  click_on 'Sign in'

  visit '/'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<h2>Adding new teachers</h2>

<p>
  As a teacher, you can list, add and remove teachers in your organization. From your organization's front page, you can find a link to list all the teachers. Remember that all teachers in the organization have same access rights as you. We recommend you add any Teaching Assistants etc. as <a href="#course_assistants">Course assistants</a>.
</p>

<%
  page.first(:link, "Helsingin yliopisto").click
  highlight 'a:contains("Show teachers in this organization")'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<%
   click_on 'Show teachers in this organization'
%>

<p>
  To add a new teacher, you will have to know the teacher's email address linked to their TMC account. Type the email
  and click 'Add a new teacher'.
</p>

<%
   fill_in 'email', with: 'professor@example.com'
   highlight '[value="Add a new teacher"]'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<p>
  You can also remove existing teachers by clicking the 'Remove' button next to their name.
</p>

<%
   click_on 'Add a new teacher'
   highlight 'a:contains("Remove")'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<h2>Creating a course</h2>

<p>
  TMC offers a selection of course templates, from which you can create your own courses. Courses created from templates will include teaching material and sets of exercises. You can customize a course created from a template by setting or removing submission deadlines, exercise unlock conditions, feedback questions etc.
</p>

<p>
  Creating a new course is done with a wizard that helps you go through the motions. To start the process, click the 'Create New Course' button from your organization's front page.
</p>

<%
  visit '/org/hy'
  highlight 'a:contains("Create New Course")'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<h3>Phase 1, course template</h3>

<p>
  You will see a list of all available course templates. As needed, you can take a look at the course description and course material. Choose a suitable template and click the 'Choose' button next to it.
</p>

<%
  click_on 'Create New Course'
  highlight 'a:contains("Choose")'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<%
  first(:link, 'Choose').click
%>

<h3>Phase 2, details</h3>

<p>
  On the following form the fields will be prefilled with template defaults. You may change these fields to suit your needs.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Course <b>Name</b> is a technical name, which is shown in IDE plugins (such as TMCBeans) and
      in directory structures. The name can't contain whitespaces or hyphens. This setting can <b>not</b> be changed later.
    </li>
    <li><b>Title</b> is a human readable (prettier) version of the name. It may contain whitespaces, and is shown on TMC pages.</li>
    <li><b>Description</b> about the course.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Material url</b> is the link to the course material, which is the main learning source for the students. Material should include the exercise prompts as well, and normally it's wise to use course's own material. If you have created your own course material, add its URL here.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<%= screenshot %>

<p>
  Finally, click the 'Add Course' button. This step might take some time as TMC populates the new course with exercices.
</p>

<%
  click_on 'Add Course'
%>

  <h3>Phase 3, assistants</h3>

<%= screenshot %>

<p>
  If you already know your course assistants, you can add them to the course now. Just fill in their email addresses linked to their TMC accounts and click 'Add new assistant'. You can add more assistants later. When you are ready, click 'Continue'.
</p>

<%
  click_on 'Continue'
%>

  <h3>Phase 4, finish</h3>

<%= screenshot %>

<p>
  The course creation is now ready. However, depending on the server load and chosen template, the exercises might be still under processing. This might take up to one hour to be completed. During that, course is not publicly visible and exercise zip files are not accessible. You can still progress to course main page, and access the settings. The course will stay hidden until you decide to publish it.
</p>
<p>
  If the server-side process was fast and ready, you can choose to publish the course right away, or keep it hidden and disabled until it is ready to be published later. Click either of the buttons, and you will be redirected to the course main page.
</p>

<%
  click_on 'Finish'
  click_on 'Enable course'
%>
  <h3>The course main page</h3>

<%= screenshot %>

<p>
  Here you can see any submissions sent to any of the exercises in this course, view model solutions, make code reviews etc. You may also access the course page from your organization's page.
</p>

<p>
  The main course page is divided into sections. First, you have the general management part, which contains links to exercise, deadline, unlock condition, assistant and general course option management screens. After that, there is the exercise list, and at the bottom, you can find your students' submissions. Remember that as a teacher (or an assistant), you will see all submissions from all students, while students see only their own submissions.
</p>

<h2>Editing course details</h2>

<p>
  You can edit the previously entered course information and some other things by clicking the 'Edit course details' button.
</p>

<p>The technical course name is permanent, and it can't be edited.</p>

<%
   visit '/org/hy'
   highlight 'a:contains("Programming 101")'
   click_on 'Programming 101'
   click_on 'Edit course details'
   fill_in 'course_external_scoreboard_url', with: 'http://my-points.io/%{user}'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<h3>External score board</h3>

<p>
  If you want to use an external point awarding system, you can enter its URL to the 'Custom points URL' field. You can also use a template string that will generate the URL dynamically. For example, <code style='white-space: nowrap'>http://my-custom-points.io/%{user}</code> would show as <code style='white-space: nowrap'>http://my-custom-points.io/MyUsername</code> when viewed by the user <code>MyUsername</code>.
</p>

<p>
  If an external score board url is set, it is shown instead of the general tmc points page when students click the 'View points' link in the course page.
</p>

  <h2>Disabling the course</h2>

  <p>
    A course may be disabled so that it won't accept submissions. You might want to do this if you're not satisified with your course and wish to start a new one, if you want to configure your course without worrying about students using your course, or if you want to force students to take a vacation. Disabled courses can be re-enabled at any time.
  </p>

<p>Simply click the 'Disable Course' link to disable the course.</p>

<%
   visit '/org/hy/courses/2'
   highlight 'a:contains("Disable Course")'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<p>Click 'Enable Course' to enable it again.</p>


<%
  click_on 'Disable Course'
  highlight 'a:contains("Enable Course")'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<%
   click_on 'Enable Course'
%>

  <h2>Course assistants</h2>

<%
  visit '/org/hy/courses/2'
  click_on 'Manage assistants'
  fill_in 'email', with: 'oldassistant@example.com'
  click_on 'Add new assistant'

%>

<p>
  Course assistants have teacher permissions for a single course, instead of the whole organization. You can add course assistants by going to the course page and clicking the 'Manage assistants' button.
</p>


<%
   visit '/org/hy/courses/2'
   highlight 'a:contains("Manage assistants")'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<p>
  Adding a new course assistant works in the same way as adding a new teacher: enter the assistant's email and click 'Add new assistant'.
</p>

<%
   click_on 'Manage assistants'
   fill_in 'email', with: 'assistant@example.com'
   highlight '[value="Add a new assistant"]'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<h2>Course progression</h2>

<p>
  To control course progression, each exercise and exercise group may be configured with deadlines and unlock conditions. If you wish to modify these, it's important to understand the concepts of a deadline and an unlock condition.
</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

  <img src="../images/exercise_deadline_unlock.png" alt="Unlocks and deadlines for exercises">

  <h4>Deadlines</h4>

  <p>
    There are two kinds of deadlines. A <b>soft deadline</b> is a deadline which is shown for students, but TMC will accept and process submissions even after that, only flagging them as late. A <b>hard deadline</b> is a strict deadline: when it has passed, TMC refuses to process any submissions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Choose the deadlines depending on your needs. For example, you can set soft deadlines for every friday evening, and hard deadline for sunday evenings to give students few days extra time if thay fail to submit in time. You can then take into account the late submissions in the grading with f.ex. a slight penalty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Deadlines can be expressed as a time and date, in which case they are shared by all students, or alternatively set as time spans, so that each student has a certain time to finish the unlocked exercise after the exercise is unlocked for the student.
  </p>

  <h4>Unlock conditions</h4>

  <p>
    The unlock condition determines when the exercise is available for the student. Two most common cases are fixed date (exercises open for all students on a certain date), or some percentage of previous exercises completed (each student can progress when they have completed enough of the previous exercises).
  </p>

  <h3>Setting deadlines</h3>

  <p>
    To setup deadlines for the exercises, click the 'Advanced deadlines management' button from the course's front page.
  </p>

<%
   visit '/org/hy/courses/2'
   highlight 'a:contains("Advanced deadlines management")'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<%
   course = Course.find_by id: 2
   course.exercise_group_by_name('Week1').hard_group_deadline = ['01.01.2011'].to_json
   click_on 'Advanced deadlines management'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<p>
    Common deadlines are configured by date or date-time. TMC understands multiple formats, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>20.1.2000</li>
      <li>30.12.2000 20:00</li>
      <li>2000-1-20</li>
      <li>2000-12-30 20:00</li>
      <li>2000-12-30 8:00 PM</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    Another way to setup deadlines is to use unique unlock-based deadlines. It means that a deadline for each student is based on the time they unlocked the exercise (see <a href="#unlock_conditions">Unlock conditions</a>). For example, to give students 2 weeks to complete an exercise after it becomes available, set the deadline to <code>unlock + 2 weeks</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    All possible values for unlock-based deadlines are:<br>
    <br>
    <code>unlock + &lt;N&gt; [minute[s]|hour[s]|day[s]|week[s]|month[s]|year[s]]</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To edit unlock-based deadlines, advanced options must be enabled by clicking the button in the top right corner of the page. If both date-based and unlock-based deadlines are enabled for the same exercise, the one which expires first will be used.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    Exercises are organized into pre-defined groups. By default, deadlines are set per group, so that all exercices in the current group will get the same deadline. If you need more customization, you can click 'Show single exercises' and set deadlines at single exercise level.
  </p>

<%
  highlight '#toggle1_Week1'
%>

<%= screenshot %>
<% click_on 'toggle1_Week1' %>
<%= screenshot %>

<%
   i = 1
   course.exercises.each do |e|
     e.deadline_spec = ["#{i}.1.2000"].to_json
     i += 1
     e.save!
   end
   visit '/org/hy/courses/2/manage_deadlines'
   disabled_text = find_field('group_Week1_hard_static', disabled: true).value
%>

<p>
  If the exercises in a group have differing deadlines, the group deadline input fields will be disabled and show '<%= disabled_text %>', so you can't accidentally override exercise specific settings.
</p>


<%= screenshot %>

<p>
  If you want to edit the deadlines for the whole group again, you need to change the single deadlines so they all match within the group. You can also reset the whole group by clicking 'Clear single deadlines'.
</p>

<%
   click_on 'toggle1_Week1'
   highlight 'a:contains("Clear single deadlines")'
%>

<%= screenshot %>

<p>When you are done with the settings, remember to click 'Save changes' at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>
  After creating a course from template, the deadlines may already be defined depending on the course template configuration.
</p>

<h3>Setting unlock conditions</h3>

<p>
  If an exercise or exercise group has an unlock condition attached to it and it has not passed yet, the exercise will not accept submissions. If there are no unlocks set, the exercise is always active.
</p>

<p>
  Unlock conditions can be set by clicking 'Advanced unlock conditions management' in the course page.
</p>


<%
   course.exercise_group_by_name('Week1').hard_group_deadline = [''].to_json
   course.exercise_group_by_name('Week2').hard_group_deadline = [''].to_json
   visit '/org/hy/courses/2'
   highlight 'a:contains("Advanced unlock conditions management")'
%>
<%= screenshot %>

<p>
  Unlock conditions may be set for each exercise group separately. You can add multiple unlock conditions for the same exercise group by clicking 'Add a condition'. If multiple conditions are defined, all of them must be true before the exercise is unlocked.
</p>

<%
   course.exercise_group_by_name('Week1').group_unlock_conditions = ['1.1.2000'].to_json
   course.exercise_group_by_name('Week2').group_unlock_conditions = ['8.1.2000', '80% of Week1'].to_json
   UncomputedUnlock.create_all_for_course_eager(course)
   click_on 'Advanced unlock conditions management'
   highlight '#add-condition-Week1'
%>

<%= screenshot %>

<p>
The conditions that can be used are:
<ul>
  <li><code>exercise [group] &lt;exercise-or-group&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>point[s] &lt;list-of-point-names&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;N&gt;% [in|of|from] &lt;exercise-or-group&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;N&gt; point[s] &lt;exercise-or-group&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;N&gt; exercise[s] [in|of|from] &lt;exercise-or-group&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;date-or-datetime&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><code>&lt;exercise-or-group&gt;</code> is the exact name for the exercise.</p>

<p>
Some common examples:
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed date:<br>
    <code>1.9.2016</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    80% of the points from some precious week<br>
    <code>80% from exercice-group-X</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Single important exercise made successfully<br>
    <code>exercise important-exercise</code>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Code review</h2>

<p>
  Code reviewing is a process in which a course teacher or an assistant goes over the code in a submitted answer and reviews it, providing comments for the students. Some exercises require a codereview to be completed. Students can also manually request a code review.
</p>
<p>
  If there are any unreviewed requests, the course front page has a link 'n code view requested'. You can start the review process by clicking on that link. Furthermore, the submission list on the bottom of the page shows whether each submission requires a review.
</p>


<%

<%= screenshot %>

<h2>Managing feedback questions</h2>

<p>
  Every course can have feedback questions, which are shown to the student after a successful submission. A question can be either free text answer or number value for selected range. For example, a numeric question could be "How difficult was this exercise? (1-5)", and a text question "What problems you had in this exercise?".
</p>

<p>
  Questions can be configured by clicking 'Manage feedback questions' from the course front page.
</p>

  On the student's page you can see summary of that student's progress on all courses. At the bottom of the page there's list of the student's submission history. If you want to check some single submission's data, you can click the corresponding 'Details' link.

<p>
  On the submission details page you can see all relevant data for that submission, including the student's answer, test results, and a suggested solution. You can also rerun the submission and start code review. Rerunning submissions will never deduct points, but can give them if the code failed to pass tests due to f.ex. randomness.

  <h2>Custom courses</h2>

    <p>
      TMC has support for creating your own courses from scratch, without using the offered course templates. This option might be disabled on the TMC server you are using, and may not be supported. Normally you don't need to bother with that, and it is for advanced users only.
